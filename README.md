# Permutations


## Description
Generates permutations filling in blanks in words. Also allows excluding letters. Handy for Codeword puzzles and Hangman.

Also applies some rules, such as requiring a vowel in a word, ignoring invalid bi/trigrams (eg "zxk", "zg").

Permutations are generated by increasing an integer and converting base 10 to base 26.

More of a script than anything else, could be handy for arbitrary conversions though.

## Example

``` powershell
> .\Perms.exe "wh?t"
Input:
wh?t
Ignoring:


what
whet
whit
whot
whut
```
